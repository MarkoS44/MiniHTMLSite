<h1> Pupin coils</h1>

Pupin's <strong>1899</strong> patent for loading coils, archaically called "<mark>Pupin coils</mark>", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <strong>Oliver Heaviside</strong>, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <mark>American Telephone</mark> & <mark>>Telegraph (AT&T)</mark>, making him wealthy. Although<mark>AT&T</mark> bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <strong>George Campbell</strong> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.<mark> AT&T</mark> were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
